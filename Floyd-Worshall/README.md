# Floyd-Worshall Algorithm
**All Pairs Shortest Path Algortihm (APSP)**
- Finds the shortest path between all pairs of nodes
- Important for many applications were shortest path is necessary for every node
- Detects negative cycles


## Time Complexity
- **O(V^3)**
- Makes this algorithm ideal for graphs not larger than a few hunndred nodes
