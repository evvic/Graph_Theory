# Depth-First Search

- Explore nodes and edges of a graph
- Time complexity of O(V + E)
- Often used as a building block as other algorithms
  - DFS alone is not very useful, but can be implemented in many useful situations!

## Basics
- DFS enters depth first into a graph, taking the next available node until it cannot go any further
  - From there it backtracks and continues
