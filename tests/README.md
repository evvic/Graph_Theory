# Test Cases

Each algorithm is used for different types of graphs, i.e. directed, undirected, weighted, non-weighted, etc...

Some algorithms also cannot work with weighted digraphs that have negative cycles.

Thus there will be folders for different case types to be ran against the algorithm they were made for.
